  <h1 class="title">Requirement Gathering</h1>
  <br />
  <p><b>Roles</b><p>   

In this process there are several roles. In this idealised description we pretend the roles are always played by different people. <p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li> The customer is the source of all requirements and money.   </li>
<li> The architect gathers requirements from the customer, and produces an architecture: descriptions of components and interfaces, and a list of largescale work items for implementing the system.   </li>
<li> As part of the architect’s requirements analysis, verification criteria are developed for all requirements, and the architect may work with developers to plan how to verify the components of the architecture.  </li> 
<li> The project manager, together with the development team, breaks down the work items into smaller tasks, estimates the work to be done in collaboration with the developers, arranges work on a timeline, and assigns work to specific individuals. They also negotiate changes to the requirements or design with the architect and customer.   </li>
<li> Developers produce the system by doing the work planned by the architect and project manager. They plan the work in detail, and produce estimates for the project manager.  </li>
</ul>
Checklist for customer who is expected to: 
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li> Explain the problems they want solved or the product they want built.   </li>
<li> Answer questions   </li>
<li> Test deliveries for acceptance.   </li>
<li> Pay their bills.  </li>
</ul>

Checklist for project architect role who has the responsibility to: <p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li> Understand what the customer wants and needs from the project.   </li>
<li> Encode this understanding in a Requirement Gathering document, as a set of well-defined requirements. – The customer may provide a non-functional requirement, which the architect keeps as a top-level requirement, and splits into mechanically verifiable requirements.   </li>
<li> Write up verification criteria for all requirements, explaining how to determine if the requirement has been met.   </li>
<li> Design a way to achieve that, and encode that in Requirement Gathering as well: high-level architecture, major components, their interactions, and the internal architectures of the major components, and downwards through the abstraction stack down to components that can be implemented without further design.   </li>
<li> Do any research and experimentation needed to make sure the design is a good one.   </li>
<li> Plan a series of implementation steps for implementing the design.  </li>
<li> Understand the current state of the implementation, and all of its known problems, and any change requests from users, customers, and adjust the design and work items accordingly.   </li>
<li> Monitor and measure project progress, together with the project manager, and guide the project to meet milestone deadlines. 
<li> Choose components that have acceptable licenses to fulfil the license requirements set by the customer, without violating any of the relevant licenses. The project architect need not do everything alone: delegation is allowed and encouraged. It is the project architect’s responsibility to ensure the delegated parts are done and done well.  </li>
</ul>

Checklist for project manager role who has the responsibility to: <p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li> Support the sales process. – Ensure the project is well understood, well-defined, and clearly scoped. – Ensure the project is well understood by the architect and engineers from the client’s or sponsor’s perspective. – Manage changes in the project purpose and communicate them clearly to engineering.   </li>
<li> Discuss priorities with the customer to understand what should be delivered and when. – Document decisions, make sure all stakeholders understand them and agree to them.   </li>
<li> Work with the architect to ensure that the captured project requirements meet the customer’s priorities and goals.   </li>
<li> With the architecture team, plan what needs to be done for the milestones, and estimate the needed work for doing that.   </li>
<li> With the engineering team, refine those estimates and ensure that everything necessary has been planned to a level of details which can be supported. – Some of this can be had from the work items produced by the architect in the Requirement Gathering document.   </li>
<li> Make sure we have what we need to achieve the milestones (people, machines, time, knowledge), and negotiate with relevant parties if not.   </li>
<li> Analyse risks and discuss them with customer and management to prepare strategies for handling them.   </li>
<li> Keep track of what everyone is doing, and make sure they are making progress at a good pace, don’t get blocked on anything, and are doing the right thing.  </li>
<li> Keep track of overall progress towards milestones, and watch out for the schedule slipping, and deal with problems when they happen.   </li>
<li> Ensure a smooth, complete (tested and documented) and timely delivery during the project, and/or at the end of the project.   </li>
<li> Look after project infrastructure. – Management reports. – Project documentation. – Project monitoring. – Project facilities.   </li>
<li> Ensure the the appropriate engineering process is used, is well defined, and understood by everyone. – Ensure the client is also informed about or involved in the engineering process, and understands it.   </li>
<li> Ensure the client is understands the risks of the project, its progress, and any current issues.   </li>
<li> Maintain the quality of, and improve, the project infrastructure.   </li>
<li> Improve the quality of the engineering.  </li>
</ul>

Checklist for developer role who has the responsibility to: <p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li> Review the architect’s output for sanity, implementability, and other aspects.   </li>
<li> Estimate the time needed to implement the parts of the project they will work on.   </li>
<li> Implement the project.   </li>
<li> Raise any problems they see with the project, the architecture design, or other parts of the project.  </li>
