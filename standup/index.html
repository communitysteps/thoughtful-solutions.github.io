	<p>Normally standups should be organised and run by the engineers, not the project manager. This is not to say that the project manager should not be present; indeed they should be there./p>
		<p>Even projects involving one engineer working solo should create daily standup minutes. Obviously this is not ideal and we should normally aim to ensure that engineers are not working 
		solo for long periods. In this case, engineers may be encouraged to simply email their standup notes to the internal project mailing list instead./p>
			<p>To avoid wasting time, it is important for all participants to be prepared ahead of time, and to not wait long for people who’re present but not alert on IRC. 
			Wake them up with whatever means, or start the standup without them. Otherwise a 10-minute standup may easily be preceded by a 15-minute wait for everyone to be be awake on IRC./p>
				<p>Standups should be recorded in the project’s log. A good name for a standup file would be standup-YYYYMMDD.mdwn in the log directory. Don’t forget to give the standup a title and a 
				date entry so that the log is kept in order. All engineers and managers associated with any given project should be capable of 
running a standup, logging the activity and pushing standup minutes to the project management wiki. </li></ul></p>

<li> the last person ends by indicating that they is finished and that the discussion may begin 
<li> the host drives the discussion by discussing the points raised in the minutes and anything that comes up during the discussion itself CRITICALLY the engineers 
should wait for the host to ask them to discuss any given point. There should never be more than one point being discussed simultaneously.

Keep it short Standups are supposed to be short. Avoid deep and long technical discussions. Instead, decide to discuss them after the standup and quickly agree a time, place and participants.
