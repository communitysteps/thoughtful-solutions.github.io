Dimona,
        What a great start.. Really liking this..
so here are the fixes..
        Move Stakeholder Questions into Requirements Gathering as the the Third Item after roles..
        Move Techniques/Kanban back to Kanban..
and replace the workflow statement with Kanban..

        Is there any way to make the following happen
   http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/kanban/
should open
   http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/kanban/kanban.html

Can we replace the directory requirements-gathering with requirements and make
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/requirements/
show
http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/requirement-gathering/mintro.html

Can we ensure that the directory
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/work-review/
is now
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/review/
and if I go to it it shows
      http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/work-review/work.html

Also if I go to
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/standup/
it shows
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/standup/standup.html
This gives me short codes to find things..

Ok another anonying point..
        When I Select an entry from the left hand boxes (commandments/gathering/standing up) the close so I have to double open them to get from say General to Coding.... Can we hold the box open ?

 -------------------------

Now for the editing of the text..

http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/requirement-gathering/mintro.html
Please loose the first sentence and begin with "The goals..."

http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/requirement-gathering/roles.html

Could we put each of the roles in Bold..
"customer" "architect" "project manager" and "developer"
and can we put each of these roles into a sub-directory
so people can check what their responsibilities are
http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/roles/customer
http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/roles/architect
http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/roles/project-manager
http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/roles/developer

In a perfect world could we have a redirect page so
http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/roles/pm
points to
http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/roles/project-manager
and
http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/roles/dev
points to
http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/roles/developer

[Please for this don't give me two copies.. you can us a single html meta tag and redirect or similar..]

http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/work-review/work.html

In a perfect world I'd like to be able to do
http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/review/ and have it point to
http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/work-revew

Please remove from the 1st paragraph Everything including the FIXME: until the end of that sentence.. Leave the Flow is as follows.

pleae remove the specifices of how to set up the git send-mail..
we'll cover this in the git tutorial you're writing.

http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/standup/standup.html

The third paragraph "Be in more than one standup at once" I'm fairly sure that isn't the formating in the PDF I sent you.. can you review it and make it into more clear rules and sections..

Someone this all seems a little text heavy and needs moving into points

http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/examples/pig.html
The graphics in the standard pig are missing and don't render

Can we put
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/examples/pig.html
into
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/standard-pig/
with a short-cut redirect as above
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/pig/
Can we put
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/examples/lego.html
into
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/lego
it will need sub-directories
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/lego/1/
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/lego/2/
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/lego/3/
as there are three rounds to the game each with different cards and requirements.

I need to add a new Menu entry "Definition of Done" it needs to point to
        http://thoughtful-solutions.github.io/done/
and in this it needs

        I basically want to recut this diagram
https://www.scrumalliance.org/system/resource_files/0000/0445/Gupta_Figure_1.png
to the colour scheme we have..
and put a chunk of this article there

https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2008/september/definition-of-done-a-reference

        reword it and make it as simple as possible..
